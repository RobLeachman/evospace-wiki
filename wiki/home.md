Concerns involve finding and extracting resources, fluid and solid logistics, resource processing for efficiency - both material efficiency and speed - handling byproducts, power management with 4 types of power concerns ([heat](heat.md), [electrical](electricity.md), [kinetic](kinetic.md), and [steam](fluid.md)), and 3-Dimensional construction.

- Endless procedurally-generated world
- No survival mechanics to keep you on your toes, just pure relaxed exploration
- Building and crafting
- Converyor logistics
- Fluid logistics
- Electrical power generation and networking
- Heat and kinetic force generation
- Resource management
- Material Processing
- Managing Byproducts
