Crafting is the core of the gameplay in Evospace.

Crafting can be done manually - this is generally best for machines that will be used and placed in small numbers - or automatically - good for frequently-used items like [[conveyor|conveyors]], [[pipe|pipes]], and [[cable|cables]].

Some crafting can only be done by [[machines]].
