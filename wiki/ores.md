Ores
====

All ores can be spawned on surface. 
Deeper under surface deposits will be bigger, but at the moment it is more usefull to build [drilling unit](drilling-unit.md) and get ores from deep deposites. At the moment they are infine. You can find known deep deposites on global map or research new deposites with [scanner](scanner.md)

Mining
------
Mining is Evospace is fairly straightforward. Select your multitool and left-click to dig. Digging on one of the oddly-colored areas of the map will produce ore of the associated type (or coal).

[Automatic Hammer](automatic-hammer.md)
------
The autohammer is the first step in fully-processing ores. It produces gravel from ores.

[Macerator](macerator.md)
------
The macerator can be used on ore in any form larger than dust (ore, impure ore gravel, or ore gravel).

[Separator](separator.md)
------
The separator cleans impure ore dust, separating the impurities. Ore dust and a secondary ingredient are produced. Copper and iron ore dust smelt faster than impure ore dust. Note that using an Industrial Separator instead of standard Separator will result producing trace amounts of certain rare mineral dusts.
